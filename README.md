- 👋 Hi, I’m @GartnerInsights
- 👀 I’m interested in keeping my profile active
- 🌱 I’m learning that employers want an individual GitHub account. I've had accounts within companies that I've worked for but not my own until Autodesk. This account includes an archived instance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding my next UX Writer or Technical Writer position.
- 📫 How to reach me michelle@gartnerinsights.com
